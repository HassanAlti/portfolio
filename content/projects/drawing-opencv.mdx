This drawing game allows users to draw on a canvas and compares their drawings
to an original image using OpenCV's contour matching technique. With a focus on
providing fun and challenging gameplay, the app also incorporates authentication
and high score tracking.

Explore the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HassanAlti/Drawing-Game) to
dive deeper into the codebase or try out the
[live demo](https://drawing-game-open-cv.vercel.app/).

## Features

- **Canvas Drawing**: Users can create drawings on a canvas using simple drawing
  tools.
- **Image Similarity with OpenCV**: The app uses OpenCV's contour matching
  algorithm to compare user drawings with a reference image and calculate a
  similarity score.
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and keep track of their
  progress with secured authentication.
- **High Score Tracking**: MongoDB is used to store and display high scores,
  encouraging competitive gameplay.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: The React framework used for building the web app, with support
  for server actions and dynamic routing.
- **TypeScript**: Used to ensure type safety and code clarity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the app and
  ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- **OpenCV**: A computer vision library used for contour detection and image
  comparison.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user data, drawings, and high
  scores.
